# About

This is an electron project that allows users to view a web view of their coding project. This webview has a terminal and shell session attached which auto-instantiates a coding agent of their choice (Claude code `claude` by default).

## Project Development

When you want to validate changes, do NOT attempt to build or run the project. Simply perform a typescript check.
